l# C Programming Exercises
I often update my C skills to sharpend my embdeed programming skills aswell as to have a more fundamental understanding of C++.



## Hackerrank

HackerRank is a platform that provides programming challenges for developers to improve their skills in algorithms, data structures, and honestly I often find these puzzling challenges fun. This repository contains my solutions to the questions in the C Preparation course. What stands out about it is that it targets a very diverse knowledge of the programmer's C skills.


## MX1
One of the most significant subjects in my degree was Mechatronics 1 (AKA MX1), where I learned how to program in C aswell as the progrmaming of a microcontroller, with the Arduino Uno using C and PlatformIO (baremetal). I have included some exercises.


## C Primer
When I started programming in MX1, I developed my fundamental skills by being challenged with this primer book given in the subject. Attached in the folder is the C Primer questions, and the corresponding answers to the questions inside the folder.
