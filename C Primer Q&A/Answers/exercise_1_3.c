/* Write a program which will ask you about your name, student number and favourite colour and print
those on separate lines. You may use either several printf instructions, each with a newline character
in it, or one printf with several newlines in the control string.
Note: Your name is an array of characters. We will look at arrays later on but I will give you an example
of a declaration of a char array of 10 letters just for the purpose of this exercise char a[10]ยง. Don't
forget to use the correct type specifier for a string of characters in your i/o functions.*/
